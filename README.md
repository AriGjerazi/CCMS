<h1><b>CAPPUCCINO</b></h1>   

Coffee shop chains are become more ubiquitous in Albania, with at least three of them being fairly prominent and well-heard to the average coffee consumer. In light of this, we can consider the possibility that a management system for this group of businesses may be in fact in demand. 

Creating such a management system would require a division between the individual administration of single stores, as well as the 'back end' of the system, regarding management of the whole chain. Another divide is between the service portion (which will involve the above two sides) as well as the supply and storage portion, dealing with the storing and delivery of materials and supplies needed for each store. 

Coordinating each individual portion of the management system would be the greatest challenge of the management system, not to mention the need to research legislation, econimics and general business management, in order to properly create the system. Beyond that, a number of schematics and diagrams will be needed to properly create an idea of the system.
